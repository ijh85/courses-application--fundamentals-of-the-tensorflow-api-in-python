## Defining Tensors in Numpy

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "12032809d0"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
```
import numpy as np

# 0D Tensor
d0 = 1

#1D Tensor
d1 = np.ones((2,))

#2D Tensor
d2 = np.ones((2,2))

#3D Tensor
d3 = np.ones((2,2,2))

print d2

## Defining Tensors in Tensorflow

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "93585c4823"
```

`@part1`
```
import tensorflow as tf

# 0D Tensor
d0 = 1

# 1D Tensor
d1 = tf.ones((2,))

# 2D Tensor
d2 = tf.ones((2,2))

#3D Tensor
d3 = tf.ones((2,2,2))

# Tensorflow requires explicit evaluation.
tf.InteractiveSession()

print d2.eval()
```

## Constants (1)

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "66e9bdfe13"
```

`@part1`
* A constant is the simplest category of tensor
  * Does not change at graph computation time
  * Can take on any dimension
  * Arbitrary values allowed


```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.InteractiveSession()

c2 = tf.constant(3, tf.float32, shape=[2,3], name="c2")

c2 = tf.constant([1., 2., 3., 4., shape=[2,2])
```
